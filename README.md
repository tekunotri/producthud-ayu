# ProductHUD (ayu theme)

![product-banner-new_small](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b7f3acb4-9ba6-4118-988e-d6d4014617bf)

the same product hud as ever, but this time with a little bit of [ayu theme](https://github.com/ayu-theme/ayu-colors) sprinkled on top

> [!WARNING]
> make sure to rename the hud folder from `producthud-ayu` to just `producthud` so customizations work!!!
